    "description": "Although Gaia, the girl who had previously launched an attack on Eden, has finally awoken, her amnesia prevents you from learning much of her origins. For the time being, the best course of action appears to be continuing with efforts to restore balance to the ambient aether of the Empty.

Your memories of Ramuh give corporeal form to the crackling aetherial energies drawn forth.",
